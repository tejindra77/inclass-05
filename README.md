# In-class Exercise Submission

This repository contains my solution for the in-class exercise. The exercise required enabling JavaScript, modifying the JavaScript code to make specific changes to the webpage, and hosting the webpage on GitHub Pages.

## About:
This exercise was completed as part of an in-class assignment. It demonstrates basic DOM manipulation using JavaScript to modify the content of a webpage dynamically.

## Files Included:
- `example.html`: HTML file containing the webpage layout.
- `css/c05.css`: CSS file containing the styling for the webpage.
- `js/example.js`: JavaScript file containing the code to modify the webpage.
- `images/`: Folder containing images referenced in the CSS file.

## Changes Made:
- Enabled JavaScript by removing comments around the script tag in `example.html`.
- Modified `example.js` to:
  1. Add a new item "cream" to the end of the list.
  2. Add a new item "kale" to the start of the list.
  3. Add a class "cool" to all list items.
  4. Update the heading to display the number of items in the list.

## How to View:
To view the webpage:
1. Visit the GitHub Pages URL: https://tejindra77.github.io/inclass-05/example.html
2. Ensure JavaScript is enabled in your browser.
